### **7. `history` (Show Command History)**
- **Task 1**: View the history of commands you've executed.
- **Task 2**: View the last 10 commands in your history.
- **Task 3**: Search for a command in your history using a keyword, for example, `history | grep "ls"`.
- **Task 4**: Re-run the last command from your history.
- **Question**: What command would you use to show a list of previously executed commands in the terminal?

### **Bonus Questions**
1. **Multiple Commands in One Line**: How would you run multiple commands in a single line, such as changing to the `Documents` directory, listing the files there, and then printing the working directory?
2. **Using Wildcards**: What does the `*` wildcard do in Linux commands, and how could it be used with the `ls` command?
3. **Combining Commands with `&&`**: How would you use the `&&` operator to run two commands, like changing to a directory and listing its contents, in a single line?

## Instructions:
- For each task, type your answer and explain what the command does.
- Try running the commands in a Linux terminal to see how they work.
- If you need to review any command, use the `man` command (e.g., `man ls`) to get detailed information about the command.
- Be sure to practice and test these commands by running them in your terminal.

Good luck, and happy learning!
