Task: Create a New Branch and Add a Text File

Objective:

Each junior team member will:

Create a new branch under the newbees branch.

Add a text file named after them (e.g., siva_task1.txt) in the main repository.

Perform the same task in both sub-repositories.

Steps to Follow:

Work from the newbees Branch:

Switch to the newbees branch to ensure your work builds upon it.

Create Your Own Branch:

Create a branch with your name as the identifier (e.g., siva-task).

Add a Text File:

Create a text file named <your-name>_task1.txt (e.g., siva_task1.txt).

Write a short message or your name inside the file.

Save and Commit Changes:

Save your file and prepare it for submission.

Push Your Branch:

Once your branch is ready, push it to the remote repository.

Repeat for Sub-Repositories:

Go to the other sub-repository.

Create a branch there and repeat the same steps to add your text file.

Submit a Pull Request:

Go to the GitHub project and submit a Pull Request (PR) from your personal branch to the newbees branch.

In the PR description, mention the purpose of your changes.

Expected Deliverables:

A new branch for each junior team member, created from newbees.

A text file with their name (e.g., siva_task1.txt) in the main repository and both sub-repositories.

A Pull Request for each branch, ready for review.
