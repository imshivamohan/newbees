mkdir (Make Directory)

Task 1: Create a new directory named test_folder inside your current working directory.
step1:cd ~ – To ensure you're in the home directory.
step2:cd Documents – To navigate into the Documents directory.

Task2:Create a directory structure where you make dir1 and inside it another directory dir2
To do this task fist we have to check where we are for that use command cd ~ . then to check type ls it will list where we are then 
we have to create the dir1 for that use command mkdir -p dir1. here -p will create a new parent directory then to list and read all the contents type ls -R so that it will shows all the contents  and also it shows the dir1 created or not.dir1 will created.
after that we have to put dir2 inside dir1 for that we have to do mkdir -p dir1/dir2 then dir2 will be created inside the dir1. after that list by using ls -R then the dir will be created.

Task3:  Create multiple directories in a single command, e.g., dir1, dir2, dir3.
to create directories in single command we have a command which is mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3. where mkdir is used for creating new empty files.
